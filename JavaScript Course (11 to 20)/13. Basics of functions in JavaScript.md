# _Basics of functions in JavaScript_


## _Functions:_
- Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript.
- A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a
 task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, 
it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.
- To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Say Hello");
}

sayHello();
sayHello();

// Output
// Say Hello
// Say Hello
```

**_Refer function:_** sayHello  | Without the parenthesis<br>
**_Call a Function:_** sayHello() | With the parenthesis
