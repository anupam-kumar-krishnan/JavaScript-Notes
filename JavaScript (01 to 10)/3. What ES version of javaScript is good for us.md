### _Earlier:_
- **_HTML:_** for content
- **_CSS:_** for beautification
- **_JS:_** for making thing dynamic

And eventually people realize, it can do alot more than that

## _ECMAscript_
- In earlier days, there were a lot of scripting languages that were coming up
- For all the browsers, it was becoming really really hard to support all of them 
- So Europan Union came into the picture
- these are <b>_European Union Computer Manufacturing Association(ECMA)_</b>
- They wrote down a set of guidelines, and <b>_JavaScript_</b> is one of those language that follows thses guidelines
- Things actually got changed when <b>ES6</b> released
- The **major change** came **after the release of ES6**

- 2015 ---> ES6
- 2017 ---> ES8
